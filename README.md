# Team LetNogo
# Project Tuesday
#### By Joan Chirinos, Susan Lin, Johnny Wong, and Thomas Zhao

Project managing website. Projects can be created and can be shared with other members. Members can send out the project ID for other teammates to search up and join. When teammates join, tasks may be delegated. Once a task is assigned or added, the user’s feed will update. Each member will also be able to comment on the completeness of their tasks (not started, working on it, done, etc.)

The database will have tables for login info, projects, tasks, etc.

There may be a messaging system which allows teammates to “comment” on work, much like how “reactions” work on Facebook. There would NOT be a reply system in order to encourage face-to-face communication; i.e. the messaging system is solely for quick comments and should be limited to very few words/characters (like 140 character tweets, but possibly shorter).

We are displaying motivational quotes and avatars for the user simply to enhance the user experience. We are also using the Dino Ipsum API to generate strings for testing code, or just as an all-purpose lorem ipsum generator for web-based projects.
